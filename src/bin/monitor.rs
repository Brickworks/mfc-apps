fn main() {
    // 1) recv msgs (cache messages that have been received, may need to add timestamps)

    // 2) analyze receied msgs and update state as needed

    // 3) Look at state and determine if commands need to be sent back.
    // Should we handle responding to commands with mutable flags? Where updating state may set them, and the sending step resets em?
